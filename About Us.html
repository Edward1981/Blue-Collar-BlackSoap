<h4><body>
    Blue Collar BlackSoap is a small two person cottage company. We produce custom and noncustom soaps.
    Our name comes from the fact that we try to produce quality soap products for bluecollar workers.
    Our noncustom soaps all contain a ruffage material and charcoal, both are used to help clean
    off the dirt and grime most often encountered in our industries.
    Working in a Cast House I would often have black hands from the smoke and ash from melting metal scrap.
    Most soaps did little to help clean my hands and often on my days off I would still retain some of that 
    workplace color on my hands. I wanted to get my hands clean, I didnt mind the dirty hands during work.
    On my days off I wanted to leave work at work and have clean hands. I mention dirty hands,
    but our soaps are designed to be full body soaps and with our various scents will also
    add a freshness to you daily routines.</body></h4>
